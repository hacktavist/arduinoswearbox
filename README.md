# Arduino Swear Box
#### A glorified hi-tech swear jar
-----------------------------------
#### Keeps track of how many times you use profanity in a sentence. Every profane word is equal to a dollar. The ForbiddenWords.txt is a text file of profane words, you can add single words to it or you can add phrases; must be on separate lines.

  * ##### using a C# program to determine if we use profanity, we send commands to an arduino that will tell a bill acceptor from a vending machine to notify us that we have to pay a dollar

  * ##### this uses the google cloud speech to text api. you can find the documentation for the api [here](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/)
