# Arduino Swear Box
--------------------
#### A glorified hi-tech swear jar


  * ##### ~~I will update the readme of this project when I have a final working product, but this is a working proof of concept~~
  * ##### using a C# program to determine if we use profanity, we send commands to an arduino that will tell a bill acceptor from a vending machine to notify us that we have to pay a dollar

  * ##### This is going to be the resting place for the google cloud speech to text build; the original build is under the microsoft_sapi_build branch. While that branch works, there are too many false positives for swearing which pretty much ruins the project
