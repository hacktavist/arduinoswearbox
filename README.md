# Arduino Swear Box
#### ---A glorified hi-tech swear jar

  * ##### I will update the readme of this project when I have a final working product, but this is a working proof of concept
  * ##### using a C# program to determine if we use profanity, we send commands to an arduino that will tell a bill acceptor from a vending machine to notify us that we have to pay a dollar
