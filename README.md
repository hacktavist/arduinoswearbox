# Arduino Swear Box
--------------------
#### A glorified hi-tech swear jar
##### *Shocker Edition*

  * ##### using a C# program to determine if we use profanity, we send commands to an arduino that will tell a relay to switch on that puts power to a _"_[_high voltage generator_](https://www.ebay.com/sch/sis.html?_nkw=DC+3V-6V+to+400kV+400000V+Boost+Step-up+Power+Module+High-voltage+Generator&_id=222522245188&&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2658)_"_

  * ##### This is going to be the resting place for the google cloud speech to text build; the original build is under the microsoft_sapi_build branch. While that branch works, there are too many false positives for swearing which pretty much ruins the project
