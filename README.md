# Arduino Swear Box
-----------------------------------
#### A glorified hi-tech swear jar
-----------------------------------
#### Keeps track of how many times you use profanity in a sentence. Every profane word is equal to a dollar. The ForbiddenWords.txt is a text file of profane words, you can add single words to it or you can add phrases; must be on separate lines.

  * ##### using a C# program to determine if we use profanity, we send commands to an arduino that will tell a bill acceptor from a vending machine to notify us that we have to pay a dollar

  * ##### This is going to be the resting place for the google cloud speech to text build; the original build is under the microsoft_sapi_build branch. While that branch works, there are too many false positives for swearing which pretty much ruins the project
