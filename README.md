# Arduino Swear Box
#### ---A glorified hi-tech swear jar

  * ##### I will update the readme of this project when I have a final working product, but this is a working proof of concept
  * ##### using a C# program to determine if we use profanity, we send commands to an arduino that will tell a bill acceptor from a vending machine to notify us that we have to pay a dollar
 * ##### This is the original build using microsoft SAPI. It is functional but there are too many false positives to be useful. Project is switching over to use the google cloud speech to text api
